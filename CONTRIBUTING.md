# Contributing to DecaLog

Hello and welcome in this short guide which aims to help you figure out how you can be helpful. I'm very excited to know you want to share your knowledge and your skills to make DecaLog a better plugin. Thank you so much for your involvement and engagement!

Note: to make this repository a safe place to contribute, DecaLog has a [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

There's actually two main ways to contribute to DecaLog:

## Submitting bugs, making suggestions, proposing new features
If you'd like to do it, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/wp-decalog/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/wp-decalog/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or found the same bug.

If you know how to fix the bug or implement your new feature, please open an issue first to discuss it before submitting a pull request - unless it is a small fix (in which case you can do so directly).

> ### _Community_
> _Discussions about DecaLog take place on this repository's [issues](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/wp-decalog/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/wp-decalog/pulls) sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations._
> 
> _Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation._

## Translating DecaLog in your language

As you already know, all events message handled by DecaLog are in English. But its interface itself is translatable.

To start to translate the DecaLog interface in your language, jump to the [official GlotPress section for DecaLog](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/decalog/) and pick the line for your language…

To find resources on translations, handbooks, guidelines, etc. your starting point is [The Polyglots Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/). This blog is the central point of the translators community, either for the core of WordPress, the plugins or the themes.
There are many interesting things on this blog that I let you discover, but the main documents – the ones I encourage you to read before you start – are:
- [The General Expectations](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/expectations/), the do’s and don’ts.
- [The Glossaries and Style Guides](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/list-of-glossaries-per-locale/), per locale.

You can get help from the community of translators of your own language, usually on the ___#polyglots___ channel of [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/), or directly from me (___@pierrelannoy___ on Slack).
