## [4.3.0] - 2024-11-22

### Added
- Compatibility with WordPress 6.6 & 6.7.

- Ability to self-update from GitHub.
- The plugin user agent is now more consistent and "standard".

### Fixed
- There's a WordPress core "feature" which causes some PII to leak (to wp.org) during plugin and theme updates. This is no more the case for this plugin.
- In some cases, a WordPress notice can be triggered concerning the loading sequence of translations.

### Removed
- Test site launching from wordpress.org plugin page.
- All Databeam hooks and libraries, as the Databeam project is abandoned.
- Dependency on wp.org for updates.

## [4.2.0] - 2024-06-16

### Added

### Changed
- To avoid name collision with some third-party configurations, the environment tag in Datadog, Loki and Grafana loggers is now named `wp_env` (it was previously `env`).
